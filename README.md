# CA_Labs 2018-2019
Computer Architecture course lab session codes for the year 2018-2019. Definitely not exhaustive as I recall there being more than 3 labs :) .

Somehow I never seemed to get the hang of this course. Managed to do relatively well in other Systems courses like Digital Design, Microprocessors, Operating Systems and Computer Networks. Computer Architecture always seemed to be terribly complicated.
